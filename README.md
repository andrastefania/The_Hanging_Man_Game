# 💻 The Hanging Man – Guess the Word Game

"The Hanging Man" is a simple and fun console-based word guessing game written in C++. The player must guess a randomly selected word one letter at a time. For each wrong guess, a visual representation of a hanging man appears on the console, along with the number of remaining lives. The game ends when the word is guessed correctly or the player runs out of lives.
